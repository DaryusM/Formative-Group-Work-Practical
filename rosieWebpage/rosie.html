            <h2> Predictive Modelling</h2>
          </div>
          <h3> What is Predictive modelling? </h3>
          <p>Predictive Modelling is an application of computing wherein historical and current data is analysed to produce a model that attempts to predict future results based on the inputs it is given. Data-mining is often utilised to collect data, which is then statistically analysed to form predictions. </p>
          <h4> Natural Disaster Prediction </h4>
          <p>One area in which Predictive Modelling is used is to help predict the occurrence and severity of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcano eruptions and wildfires. These natural phenomena can have a detrimental effect on human life and society; destroying belongings and livelihoods, misplacing communities, hurting local wildlife and taking human lives . By effectively predicting the occurrence and spread of these events,  mitigating measures can be taken to lessen their impacts.

            Wildfires are one of the natural events that have had successful predictive models made from them in the past. One of the most substantial models for wildfires is the University of San Diego’s ‘Firemap’. This online tool allows users to plot current or potential fire areas and the application will predict the fire spread and behaviour. The user can input a number of variables, such as humidity, dryness of soil and wind behaviour, to get a more accurate prediction of the fire’s behaviour. Through this tool, communities and fire services can more accurately predict fire patterns and act accordingly, such as putting in place fire barriers, turning off electrical and gas infrastructure in the area, and evacuating people where needed. These prediction based actions are beneficial to society, as not only do they mitigate negative effects by encouraging proactive preventative measures, but also through surgesting to people and companies when measures are not needed, such as if it predicts the fire will turn away from an upcoming community, preventing people from being needlessly displaced or services being needlessly cancelled.
            
            An area where the positive impacts of fire predictive models can be clearly shown is with the FireAld initiative in Turkey. This project used historical, geographical and meteorological data alongside machine learning algorithms and inputs from a global range of experts and sponsors, to make models that helped predict wildfires. The resulting model had an 80% accuracy rate in predicting wildfires 24 hours before their outbreak and dramatically helped services involved appropriately plan and react to the events.
          </p>
          <h4>Fraud Prediction</h4>
          <p>Predictive modelling can be used by companies to help detect and prevent fraud. By analysing large amounts of data concerning past fraud cases, a model can be produced that predicts whether incoming activity is fraudulent or not. The model can also help predict ways in which methods of fraud could change before they take place, allowing companies to put in safeguards. This offers much to society as it reduces time and money lost to fraud for both the company and their customers.

            A particular predictive model for fraud detection is predicting whether credit card transactions are fraudulent or not. Almost every mainstream bank utilises predictive models to protect themselves and their customers against fraud. The models are constructed by using past data from fraudulent and genuine credit card transactions- identifying how characteristics such as; age of the bank account, past purchases made, location of the transaction request and amount of funds within the account, can point to cases where fraud is likely. These models can then analyse incoming transactions to detect fraud cases, and also prevent future fraud by denying services to those making a credit account that seem likely to commit fraud in the future.  
          </p>
          <h3>Predictive Modelling’s Contributions to Society</h3>
          <p>Overall Predictive Modelling and the data mining and predictive analytics behind it have contributed much to society. It enables people to make informed predictions about upcoming events and behaviours- allowing them to appropriately plan and react. This in turn can save money, time, possessions and even human life. The impacts of Predictive Modelling go much further than the cases discussed above. It can also be used to optimise supply chains, make predictions on an individual's risk levels to certain cancers, give weather warnings and so much more. All of these predictions then allow for a more efficient and effective society as issues can be tackled and processes optimised before the event even takes place. </p>
