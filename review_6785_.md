# A lovely review of this code

## i Interest of Content

Very interesting, and we like all the pictures!

## ii Consistency and Quality of Representation

Some issues with consistency between pages - navbar changing size, etc. Same font used across website which is good, but margains and spacing is very varied.

Some photos overlap with footer eg. Cryptography page

## iii Quality of written presentation

Well written articles

## iv Validity of HTML

NAVBAR links do not work on "data analysis" page, and are broken on many other pages. Links in footers to sources of images are not hyperlinked on some page

##Â v Evidence of Collaberation

Good collaberation - evidence that people did not do their own credits which is great
