  <h2 style="padding: 10px;">Data Analysis</h2>
  <h5 style="padding: 1px;"> Data analysis allows data to be inspected, cleaned, transformed and modelled to discover useful informtion and allows conclusions to be drawn. 
    It is critical to society, for a handful of reasons.</h5>
  <h6>There are many sectors of society that data analysis is significantly important in, such as:</h6>  
  <ul>
    <li>Informed Decision Making</li>
    <li>Heathcare and Medicine</li>
    <li>Public Policy and Governance</li>
    <li>Business Competitiveness</li>
    <li>Scientific Research</li>
    <li>Environmental Protection</li>
    <li>Education</li>
    <li>Predictive Analytics</li>
    <li>Financial Decision-Making</li>
    <li>Social and Demographic Insights</li>
    <li>Disaster Management</li>
    <li>Quality Improvement</li>
    <li>Crime Prevention and Law Enforcement</li>
    <li>Innovation and Technology Advancements</li>
  </ul>
  <h6> The importance of data analysis</h6>
  <p> Without computing, data analysis would be much much harder. Nowadays, algorithms and programming allow data analysis to be carried out with ease.
     Many big businesses (for example, supermarkets) collect data from their customers in various ways, use algorithms to analyse it and find any patterns, and then use their findings to help optimise sales and customer satisfaction.
    Although some people disagree with the collection of data due to privacy concerns, there are many data protection laws in place to stop any malpractice occuring, data analysis is very beneficial to companies as it allows them to understand their customers better and increase the efficiency and profitability of their stores. </p>

  <h6>Big Data</h6>
  <p>Big data describes large and complex sets of data that are too difficult to process using traditional data management. It is characterised by the 3Vs, which are <b>Volume, Velocity and Variety</b></p>
  <p>Volume refers to the amount of data, Velocity refers to the speed of data processing and Variety refers to the speed of data processing. Big data can make it possible to gain more complete answers because you have more information. More complete answers means that there is more confidence in the data, meaning the data is more meaningful than the average data

    <h6>Data Analysis Process</h6>
    <p>Data analysis typically consists of several iterative processes, which are described below</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Identity</b>- What information are you looking to gather and what question would you like to be aswered</li>
      <li><b>Collect</b>- The data sets you'll need to help answer the question identified</li>
      <li><b>Clean</b>- Prepare the data for analysis, remove anomalies and duplicates</li>
      <li><b>Analyse</b>- Use various data analysis techniques to find trends, correlations, outliers and variations</li>
      <li><b>Interpret</b>-Use the reulsts to see how well the data answered the original question</li>
    </ul>
