        <h2>Computing In Medicine</h2>


        <p>
            Computers have vast uses in the field of medicine and healthcare, such as patient diagnosis, drug discovery
            and surgery. By using
            computers more lives can be saved tasks can be done quicker and cheaper. Techniques such as machine
            learning, computer vision, <a href="#">data analysis</a> and <a href="./rosieWebpage/rosie.html">predictive
                modelling</a> are
            frequently used.
        </p>


        <h4>Patient Diagnosis</h4>


        <div>
            <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7089626/pexels-photo-7089626.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1"
                alt="MRI scans of brain" height="250" class="p-3 float-end ">
        </div>
        <p>
            Diagnosis of patients is done by analysing data collected from the patient, whether it be as images/scans or
            measurements like blood pressure. Machine learning techniques including <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression analysis</a>, <a
                href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/overview#:~:text=In%20machine%20learning%20too%2C%20we,unlabeled%20examples%20is%20called%20clustering.">clustering</a>
            and many more can be used to find patterns in data it is trained on and give a patient a diagnosis. Although
            there is a lot of discussion on the quality of the data these are trained on, by having bias or data
            inconsistencies, using these models can make diagnosis quicker and more reliable, the doctor may miss
            something which the computer can pick up. Medical imaging can also be analysed by computers by using object
            detection, which is implemented using <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural networks</a>. In
            a nutshell, this is a neural network that uses convolution layers to detect features, like an outline of a
            tumour. Moving away from machine learning/data analysis, image processing is a technique in which diagnosis
            can be helped. An example of this being used is in x-ray images, applying processes like edge detection and
            increased contrast abstracts the image showing key things, so a doctor can more easily identify bone
            fractures and fragments.


        </p>


        <h4>Drug Discovery</h4>


        <p>
            This has been greatly accelerated by the use of computers, being able to process many different possible
            drugs very quickly. Computers can store information of many different chemicals and see how they can
            interact with different cells and proteins in the body. Seeing the effectiveness early on lets the
            scientists ignore cases soon without wasting much time and money leading to nothing. Quantitative structure
            activity relationship models (<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_structure%E2%80%93activity_relationship">QSAR</a>) are
            ones that predict the activity of cells by chemicals, this also uses regression. To be able to discover new
            drugs, lots of processing is required to test possible ones.
        </p>


        <h4>Robotics in Surgery</h4>


        <div>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Cmglee_Cambridge_Science_Festival_2015_da_Vinci.jpg/330px-Cmglee_Cambridge_Science_Festival_2015_da_Vinci.jpg"
                alt="da Vinci Surgical System" width="250" class="p-3 float-end">
        </div>
        <p>
            By using high precision robots, that are controlled by the surgeon, surgery can be done a lot more safely
            and the use of robots is said to <a
                href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2022/may/robotic-surgery-safer-and-improves-patient-recovery-time">speed
                up patient recover</a>. Robots make it so the patient doesn't need to have an incision as large,
            reducing a lot of the risk, as the robots have cameras attached very close to the "hands", some even
            creating 3D visualisations making the surgeon more concentrated and giving them a better view. Many of the
            shortfalls of a humans biomechanics are overcome with these, such as significantly more precision with much
            more finer movements and less shaking and dexterity. It is also said that patients time in a hospital and be
            reduced by 20%! (see previous link)
