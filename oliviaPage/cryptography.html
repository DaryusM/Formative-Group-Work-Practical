    <h2>Cryptography</h2>

    <h3>What is Cryptography?</h3>
    <p>Cryptography is a very mathematical application of Computer Science with the goal of making messages unreadable with a key, so that messages and data can be communicated securely. </p>
    
    <h4>There are three main 'eras' of cryptography that we consider:</h4>
    <ul>

      <li>Text-based ciphers/Historical cryptography.</li>

      <li>Internet cryptography (that we use now) - the RSA algorithm.</li>

      <li>Post-Quantum Cryptography - cryptography once the quantum computer comes into effect.</li>

    </ul>

      <h4>Text-based ciphers/Historical Cryptography: </h4>
      <p>Throughout history (pre-computer), society has seen the evolution of text-based ciphers, where we take a given plaintext (message) and manipulate the text in some way to generate our ciphertext.</p>
      <p>This can involve physically manipulating the positions of the words in the text (Transposition Ciphers), or mapping the plaintext letter to its corresponding cipher text letter (Monoalphabetic Ciphers). </p>
      <p>Whilst in the past, these ciphers have proven very effective in keeping messages secure. However, with computers, these ciphers can now be brute-forced in a matter of seconds, effectively rendering them redundant.</p>

    <h4>Internet Cryptophraphy</h4>
    <p>As mentioned, we can no longer use text-based ciphers to keep our communucation secure. Therefore, we have resorted to a much more mathematical approach of both symmetric and public key encryption.
      With symmetric encryption, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message (text-based ciphers are a form of symmetric encryption). An example of internet symmetric encryption is AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
      It is a block cipher, meaning bits of a specified length are encrypted with the key. You can read more about AES <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">here</a>. </p>
    <p>
      Public key encryption envolves the use of key pairs. Where the sender encrypts with the receiver's public key, so that the receiver can decrypt with their private key (that never gets shared).
      The most famous public key encryption is the RSA algorithm with involves the use of extremely large, random, prime numbers and modulus arithmetic. For a more in depth description you can read about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>The only issue with the Internet cryptography that we use today is that whilst current computers are unable to break the key, the quantum computer will be able to. </p>

    <h4>Post-Quantum Cryptography</h4>
    <p>Whilst the quantum computer is still in development, the combats to cryptography are also still in development. However, so far, vectors feature prominently. 
      For example, the Shortest Vector Problem and the Closest Vector Problem. You can read more about them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography">here</a>
